This is a Navier-Stokes Solver based on Projection method and stagger scheme which is able to solve the multiphase problems.
For some commonly used interface capture metheds(E.g. CLSVOF: Coupled of Level Set and Volume of Fluid,CCL: Component Connected Labeling,Fast Sweeping,Reinitialization), I uploaded it in another branch.
